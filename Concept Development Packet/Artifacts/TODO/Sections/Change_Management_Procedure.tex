% Change Management Procedure

When it is determined that the TODO requires a revision, an engineering change order must be filled out (See ECO-000). The proposer will be the ECO owner. The proposer should include a description and justification of the proposed changes.
~\\~\\
A completed copy of the ECO and TODO will be presented to the members of the team. When team feedback is implemented a completed copy will be sent to contacts at IMSAR for approval, after  IMSAR's approval we will send the revision to Dr. Jensen for approval. For the proposed changes to be approved and implemented three signatures are required: The capstone team leader, a pod instructor, and a representative from IMSAR. Once the ECO is approved the proposed changes will be made to the TODO, and the revision history table filled out. If the ECO is rejected, no changes will be made.
