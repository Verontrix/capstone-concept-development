% Summary of Requirement Vailidation

The requirements matrix (see REQ-001 artifact) is a result of direct feedback from IMSAR's VP of Engineering, Daniel Gunyan, and Project Engineer Lead, Mark Catanzaro. In our first meeting with Daniel, we learned more about the scope of the project, and generated a rough outline of market requirements and some performance measures.  After that meeting, we drafted the first iteration of our requirements matrix that we presented in person to Mark the following week.  As part of this meeting with Mark, we were able to see the current system in use, and address a variety of questions (see NOTE-001). After our discussion, Mark made minor changes to our performance measures, and gave us approval for the matrix via email (see REQ-002).

Since gaining Mark's initial approval, we have made changes to both the market requirements and the performance measures for improved clarity and measurability. We have stayed in contact with Mark via phone calls and emails during the revision process. In our most recent discussion with Mark, we went over our key success measures and he approved of them (see NOTE-003).\\
