\chapter{Summary of Requirement Validation}

In order to validate our requirements matrix we maintained close contact with IMSAR. We discussed our first draft with Daniel Gunyan (VP of engineering, IMSAR), received feedback from him and established the primary requirements.
We discussed our 3rd draft with Mark Catanzaro (Verification Engineer) and did some major revisions on the Requirements Matrix.

After those revisions we sent Mark an email of our 4th draft. Mark and Daniel went over our 4th draft, added a couple of minor requirements, adjusted the wording and limits of a couple of the requirements. We now have our current requirements matrix approved by Daniel and Mark. Our Key Success measures were taken from the requirements matrix. See REQ-002.
