\frontmatter

%You should comment out or erase the page below to make your package.


% This document provides help on creating your Concept Design Report. It includes a sample title page and representative headings for the Design Summary, which can also be inserted as a pdf file. We are providing this template as a suggestion to help your team create a high quality Concept Design Report. The template includes suggestions for layout and formatting so that you don't have to worry about figuring these details out. You can and should adapt the contents of the report \emph{as appropriate for your project.}

% You do not need to include all of the representative sections. You may include additional sections. Your decisions about what to include should be guided by the desire to communicate clearly and concisely.

% The artifacts listed in the Primary Artifacts and Secondary Artifacts sections are typical, but your project may require different
% artifacts.  Use appropriate artifacts for your project.

% Please refer to the Evaluation rubric for the Concept Development Stage Approval Package (see Stage Approval: Concept Development in the Capstone Reference) for information about how the report will be evaluated. Hopefully, these guidelines will help you better understand the rubric. If you have questions, please ask.

% The formatting of your report is largely up to your team. You must allow a 1 inch margin on all unbound edges, and a 1.5 inch margin on the bound edge. You may use either single- or double-sided printing. If you have no preference, we suggest you print double-sided.  Please refer to Stage Approval: Concept Development in the Capstone Reference for detailed formatting requirements.

% We recommend that your document be largely in black and white.  Color will cost more to print and the color printers have lower capacity (in terms of pages per minute) than the black and white printers; this will affect you at the end of the semester when everyone is trying to print at the same time.

% NOTE: THIS TITLE PAGE SHOULD NOT BE PART OF YOUR STAGE APPROVAL PACKAGE.  THE TEMPLATE BEGINS ON THE NEXT PAGE.

%% If you want to insert the Design Summary as a pdf file, uncomment the lines below, and delete or comment out all of the Design Summary text.
%\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Design Summary}
%\includepdf[pages=-]{DESIGN_SUMMARY_NAME.pdf}

\addcontentsline{toc}{part}{Design Summary}

The first 2--4 pages of the Concept Design Report contain the Design Summary, whose main elements are described here.  The Design Summary should not be more than 4 pages; you will have to work hard to get an excellent Design Summary, because there's not much space!


\input{Not_Artifacts/Design_Summary/Introduction.tex}

%The introduction is a place to present the problem to be solved in broad terms.
%It may be helpful to briefly discuss the project sponsor and how solving the problem will advance the goals of the sponsor.
%You may wish to include your Project Objective Statement here.
%The introduction should summarize the most important market requirements, performance measures, ideal values, and target values, including the key success measures. You will likely wish to refer to the project contract and the system requirements matrix artifacts.
%After reading this section, the reader should clearly understand the most important performance goals for your product.
%Tables will likely help to clearly and succinctly communicate your requirements. 


\input{Not_Artifacts/Design_Summary/SelectedConceptsAndJustification.tex}

%This section of the Design Summary gives a summary description of the product as currently defined. It provides a summary of the answer to stage approval question 1  ``What is the selected concept?''. It is not expected to provide the complete answer to the question, which would be answered by the design package artifacts.
%Generally, photographs, renderings, sketches, block diagrams, and similar kinds of images will be helpful in conveying the product description.
%If you choose to use photographs, do your best to make them high-quality photographs. It is generally better to include people in the photographs. You should always be aware of the background. Eliminating clutter in the background (or foreground) of your photographs will help them communicate better.

%This section of the Design Summary provides a summary of the answer to stage approval question 2, ``How have your proven that your concept is best and meets the key success measures and other requirements?'' 
%It summarizes methods you have used that demonstrate your chosen concept is judged to be the best among a relatively large number of concepts. You should refer to one or more concept selection artifacts for more details.
%It also summarizes how well the system has been demonstrated to perform through tests applied to prototypes and models. You should refer to artifacts that define the prototypes and models, the test procedures, and the results.
%Tables can be effective methods for communicating the performance testing results, particularly for tests related to the key success measures.

%Artifacts should always start on a right-hand page.  \LaTeX will automatically take care of this for you if you are using the \LaTeX template. If not, the easiest way to do this is to make all of your artifacts have an even number of pages by adding a blank page if necessary.
